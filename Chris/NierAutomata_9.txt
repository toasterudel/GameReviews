The combat in this game really appealed to me as I love hack and slash games, and I'm also a fan of bullet hell games. So overall the combat kinda hit the nail on the head for me. I was initially put off but the travel time from place to place but a little into the story you unlock the equivalent to fast travel so that's nice. I really enjoyed how this game went into the thoughts of what it means to be alive / what it means to be human. A person who played only the ending of 2B probably would rate the game much lower than what I have, but you truly get to see 9S's dive into insanity and much more after you complete the story a second time through. The ending sequence was spectacular and the empathy it thrusts onto the player is just exceptional. Idk how to end reviews so if you want to play this game I'd highly recommend it
