When I first played through Undertale, I did a normal run leveling up normally and everything. I really liked the characters so after a little I turned into a bit of a pacifist and completed the run. Bullet hell games are really fun for me, and the combat in this game goes above and beyond what bullet hell should be. There is a ton of heart poured into this game and I recommend anyone plays through this game multiple times. The characters and music and art style are all easily remembered and really leaves a lasting impact on the player.

Playtime: 16 hours
