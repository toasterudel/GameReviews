Thoughts:
The idea of having a game that contains multiple art styles and game mechanics 
is cool in concept, but the game is too long and not really great in any particular 
genre to catch my interest. The game really is a jack of all trades, master of none. 
The first game is about the same, but its short length kept the idea bearable. After 
6 hours I feel like the gimmick has really just lost its charm.
