Thoughts:
While pokemon is still a great franchise and Im glad they took a new direction, I am overall 
just tired of playing mobile titles on my 3ds. This game could not captivate me like its 
predecessors, I think it has to do with the removal of gyms, mainly replacing them with 
over simplified trials that are often boring and easy.
