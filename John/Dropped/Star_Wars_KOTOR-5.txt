Thoughts:
Kotor I'm sure is a great game. From reading the narrative online I can deduce that it 
would be a great story to engage in over a few hours. However the game mechanics themselves 
are awful. Not awful for the time they came out but by todays standards the game is hard 
to play. Unfortunately there is no mini map making world navigation almost impossible and 
the combat is all based on a D&D style roll20 system. Honestly I would have liked to play 
this as a Pen and Paper RPG rather then in game form.
