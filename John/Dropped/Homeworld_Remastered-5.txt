Thoughts:
RTS games sound fun, bringing large scale tactics into the world and allowing players to make decision 
in my mind sounds amazing. Yet, I can't for the life of me play RTS games, whether it be the plethora 
of shortcuts and key combos. I just cannot understand them and I am always just so bad at them 
so I need to drop this game.
