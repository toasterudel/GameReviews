Thoughts:
The idea of a music based rpg is awesome. the idea that u can import ur own songs is even more awesome, 
but playing it just doesn't feel right. Also its a rouge-like without an end so there isnt much point 
in playing with the same songs on over and over with only changing the dungeon maps.
