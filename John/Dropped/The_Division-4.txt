Thoughts:
A Destiny clone, and a failure of a Destiny clone at that. It has no plot at all, possibly less 
then Destiny and it makes it impossible to justify any of the missions thru out the game world. 
The story also comes in to question with most of the bad guys, basically if your not apart of 
The Division, you're going to be hostile and be forced to die. I don't know how many times I've 
wanted to leave looters alone but been forced to mow them done. Its the apocalypse and I think its 
justified for them to scavenge for goods to stay alive, but for some reason they all must die. I also 
hate how all actual "civilians" hate you instantly and run from the sight of you and your guns. I cant 
even put the gun away and it makes me feel like a monster even though I'm trying to save them. Also 
this is foremost a team game, something that solo players should stay away from. That's fine in most 
regards, but when enemies scale to the highest level part member it becomes extremely difficult to play 
with friends unless you are within the same 2-3 levels. I cant say much about the end game or the dark 
zone because I dropped the game around level11 after a sad amount of time spent grinding and sulking 
through the beautiful NYC. (Graphics and detail the only saving grace of this otherwise awful game)
