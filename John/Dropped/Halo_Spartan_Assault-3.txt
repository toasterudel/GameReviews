Thoughts:
This game is a perfect example of device specific mechanics being ported to a device that was 
intended to be used. This game works decently as a mobile twin stick shooter, at its best its 
just a point and move,  nothing interesting game play wise. However, moving this game into an 
actual gaming space it becomes a nightmare, the quality is very low budget and the difficulty 
curve is almost down right insane. Even when playing coop with friends this game ended up being 
difficult, tedious, and boring. Its to the point that I will never pick up a Halo mobile game 
again, just because of this game.
