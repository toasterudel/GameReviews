Thoughts:
While the game offers a huge swath of content and things to do in the world of tamriel, the ultimate culmination of my playtime felt shallow.
The stories between each quest felt low quality and not very rewarding. While I understand this is common in MMOs to facilitate tons of content,
it did just not click with me overall. Thus Im dropping the game until furthur notice.
