Thoughts:
Freedom Planet is a decent game that does well with carrying the torch of what makes 
the original 2d Sonic games great. However, in its need to be different than Sonic it 
added a combat system that is clunky and unfun. The reliance on combat to push plot 
and add variety is what ultimately led me to dropping the game.
