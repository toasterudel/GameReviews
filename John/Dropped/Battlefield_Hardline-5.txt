Thoughts:
This game literally has nothing in common with the Battlefield franchise other then its name. 
As its own IP perhaps it could have done better but when you weigh this game as a Battlefield 
game it just doesn't stack up. The story plays out like a bad and rather ridiculous episode of 
Hawaii Five-0, with literally every single character betraying you at least once to push the 
story forward. Then the main meat and potatoes, the multiplayer is both dull and uninspired. 
Every maps design lacks depth and none of the maps truly feel like the lend themselves to balanced 
and fun vehicle combat. In the end it was just a painfully average FPS draped with a drug war 
to try to give it flavor.
