Thoughts:
Honestly the gameplay is pretty repetetive and thats what is holding me back. While I like the idea of a gridless turn based strategy game, 
the constant walking every character place to place eats up a lot of time and begins to make the game feel more tedious when more troops 
are added. The story was cool, with an alternate WWII type setting, but ultimately not enough to keep me engaged with the otherwise boring and 
drawn out gameplay.
