Thoughts:
While this is a good game, I've already played it 10 years ago with the original Pokemon Ruby and 
playing it again just wasn't something I was willing to do. It just couldn't capture the magic 
like the original did, possibly because of its 3d nature and I prefer the 2d Pokemon over the 3d.
