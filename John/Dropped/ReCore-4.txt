Thoughts:
The core game play of the ReCore is rather well done, gun play is fun and the movement system is 
challenging yet exciting to use in platformer scenarios. However, the main problems come from a 
major lack of story (which is a shame considering the Joseph Statham, the man behind Halo, had 
his hand in writing it) and its intense grinding of levels just to do menial tasks such as progress 
in the main story. The grind caught up to me towards the very end and with an appalling map set up 
and an excruciatingly boring grind I just had to walk away, the fun just got drained out.
