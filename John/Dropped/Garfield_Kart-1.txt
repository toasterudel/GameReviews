Thoughts:
Easily one of the worst games I have ever played on PC. This game is clearly some sort of messed up
mobile port, the menus can only be controlled with the mouse. The gameplay is a cheap Mario Kart
imitation and the game can barely maintain 30 fps at any point. The game is hilariously slow, poorly made, 
and the lack of multiplayer makes it an absolute waste of time. Other than the neat Garfield graphics/animation
this game is a total cash grab and should never be played.
