Thoughts:
While half life had a great mix of puzzle solving and shooting eventually the game fizzled out for me. 
After a while it just felt repetitive, the 6 hours I have in it felt like 20, and I didn't really want 
to continue. The games monster's  were interesting but ultimately left me wanting a more horror based 
campaign to fit the monster's, not just a strange facility lab escape.
