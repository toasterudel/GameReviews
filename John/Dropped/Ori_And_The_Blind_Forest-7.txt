Thoughts:
Ori has one of the strongest narrative openings I've seen. Instantly it makes you fall in love 
with a character, and then rip him away. All with almost 0 actual words spoken which is a very 
powerful thing to do. The art and music direction is beautiful, its easily one of the best games 
to look to when discussing how art and music can really bring a game together. The reason I'm 
dropping this game though is the gameplay. While is can be fun at times I often find it frustrating 
and repetitive and unfortunately I just don't have the patience/time investment I think this game 
requires to be truly played to completion.
