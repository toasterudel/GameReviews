Thoughts:
The mystery Dungeon games are fine, but are both repetitive and tiring to play through. 
The stories are predictable and drawn out, which makes it so hard to invest time into 
the boring random dungeon experience. Dropping this game also stems from my disillusion 
with my 3DS, as I find the only games I actually play on it are the main stream Pokemon 
titles. Either way it just wasn't fun to play, and for that reason I dropped it.
