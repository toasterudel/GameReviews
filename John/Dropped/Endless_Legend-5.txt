Thoughts:
While the game is fun to play with friends, single player leaves much to be desired. The gameplay itself is long,
trvial, and requires a good deal of micro management. Even in a full game of players I rarely saw anyone go to 
war and I even saw fewer alliances made. After 8 hours of play I have yet to even see a civilization fall. I believe
the game has well intentions and for people who enjoy long term strategy games it is perfect. But for a casual fan
like me the games are too long and the learning curve to high for me to fully enjoy.
