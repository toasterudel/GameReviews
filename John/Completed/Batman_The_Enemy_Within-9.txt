Thoughts:
As someone who has considerable knowledge of the Batman lore, I found this game to be
incredibely refreshing, its not often that a wholey knew take on the Dark Knight comes 
around but here I think TellTale did a great job at subverting expectations. The story 
sees Wahler trying to weasel her way into Gotham and gain control of the major players 
of the underworld. This leads to Bruce Wayne becoming a villian himself as he goes undercover
inside the crime syndicate to gather as much intel as possible before they're big job. 
During all of this you mean the Joker before he turns and get to watch as Harley manipulates him 
(instead of the normal other way around) and you watch Bruce try to help as he eventually spirals
into his final self. This awesome story is accentuated by a personal struggle within Bruce as 
he decides whether or not to be the Batman. Whether its his love affair with Cat Woman or his 
failing relationship with Alfred. Definitely one of the best telltale games I've played, and 
I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Batman.
