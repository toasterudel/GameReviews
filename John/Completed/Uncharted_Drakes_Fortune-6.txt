Thoughts:
The cinematic nature of Uncharted is really one of the coolest parts about this game. 
From the music to the general in game feel, I get a sense of being Indiana Jones and 
its really something that few other games really capture. The gun play was not as great 
as it could have been and the cover system was also lacking, but overall the game was 
really awesome and a great start to the Uncharted franchise.
