Thoughts:
The cliff hangar that Halo 5 leaves off on is equivalent to the hype 
left at the end of Halo 2. After years of going on the offensive it 
seems as if humanity's creations (AI) are turning against them in an 
effort to enslave the galaxy. Also While it was cool to see several 
famous Spartan (Linda, Fred, Kelly) sometimes they just felt unnecessary 
and almost felt tacked on to enhance the COOP campaign. I mean unless 
you've read the books these characters are completely new and the game 
does an awful job at illuminating who they actually are. The multiplayer 
on the other hand, is a welcome jump back to the traditional arena combat 
of Halo's past and with free maps and an excellent forge mode I'd say they 
really out did themselves on the multiplayer side.
