Thoughts:
Insanely charming lego adventure. Super funny, great depth with the marvel lore. 
Combat combos can be a bit too long but other than that a fun and easy game to 
chill with. Perfect for friends. Most lego games are good, but all the subtle shots 
they take at the bad parts of the Marvel cinematic universe are hilarious. 
(Particularly the Fantastic 4 stuff). Overall pretty enjoyable experience, 
even if it is a kids game.
