Thoughts:
Infinity Ward's first jump into a new franchise since Modern Warfare 
and the results are rather lack luster. While I did find the campaign 
strangely compelling in a destabilized post war California, the ending 
almost ruined the entire narrative. It forced a sequel way to hard and 
was probably put in there by the publisher on the off change that the 
game did well. The multiplayer is fine, the sliding mechanic becoming 
a staple of COD in future installments, but the failed attempt at 
battlefield levolution and a super low health pool  brought the multiplayer 
down and turned it from Black Ops 2's strategy based gun fights to 
a more speed bases encounter system that relies on much less skill.
