Thoughts:
I think the ambition was there but the game didn't hold up to what they wanted. 
I think it drew way to much from the book to the point where I feel obligated 
to read the book just to understand the plot. I originally thought the goal was 
to save my metro station by getting reinforcements but then it turned into this 
whole other story about using some giant rockets (That they just have) to 
destroy the hive. I will be honest the mechanics and base game play is good, 
but the under developed story left a ton to be desired. (For instance the Nazis 
and the Reds exist in the metro. they touch on it like twice)
