Thoughts:
A step in the right direction for COD, but ultimately too little too late. The zombies is pretty average, with small exceptions 
like a more linear based story to opening up the main map and the psuedo interesting smaller map. (Trying to capitalize on Nacht Der Untoten's success) 
The campaign was pretty good. It had a decent balance between stealth, normal, and vehicle combat. Stand out sections including the piloting sections 
with great cinematic camera shots and the Liberation mission with its unique opening of walking around the Nazi embassy and having to remember your fake documentation.
Nothing super new for gaming in general but it was nice to see it in COD. The multiplayer honestly, is probably the worst part about the game.
The return to boots on the ground combat should be praised, but the horrendus map design gives players almost no actual routes to travel 
and barely any cover in strange and winding maps. The 3 lane system is king for COD and instead they created an awful mishmash of lanes and 
flanks that ultimately detract from the player experience. The weapon selections are fine and the new hub world is a fun addition between 
matches. The spawns however, are also a shame and often have players spawning right next to enemies or away from the combat. While a step in
the right direction it remains to be seen if this will be a bounce back point for COD or the beginning of an actual end. 
My money being on the latter.
