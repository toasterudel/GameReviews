Thoughts:
With a great cast of characters and an interesting plot to create a dynamic open world, TT games really nailed it again with this one.
The ability to seemlessly walk between universes really helps to create a set of diverse missions to play
without really getting bogged down in any particular zone. The writing was funny as always, but the overall story could have
used some work. The game play was fun, with each character feeling unique despite the hundred+ characters in the game. My only main gameplay gripes
are the overworld tasks to unlock the missions that felt tedious, and the rule of three was over used in every aspect of the game.
Sometimes doing something once is enough. However, overall I think this game was a great installment in the LEGO Marvel series, albeit
not as good as the original Lego Marvel story wise.
