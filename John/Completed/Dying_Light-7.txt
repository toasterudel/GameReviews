Thoughts:
A zombie survival game is nothing new, but dying light adds a fresh new system 
with its rather well designed parkour mechanic.  Dying Light's parkour system 
feels organic and the level design suits it rather nicely. The story is a 
little weak but nothing to laugh at for the typical zombie experience. Another 
good point about this game is the danger that night actually brings by scaling 
all enemies at night and even adding some new ones, giving the game a more 
"28 days later" kind of vibe. The only main complaint is that some enemy types feel 
copied from other zombie games and the late game grappling hook kind of trivializes 
the whole main mechanic of parkour by just grappling over things.
