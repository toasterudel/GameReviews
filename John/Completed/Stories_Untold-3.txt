Thoughts:
This game at its core is severly flawed. While the premise of a Zork style adventure inside of a 3D horror game 
could possibly work, the actual implementation is awful. Zork has a more robust and responsive vocab libary and 
it was one of the first PC games ever created. This game's input commands are hyper specific and I 100% would not 
think of them unless I looked them up. All cutscenes are unskipable, and you can't interact with anything until 
people are done talking. The story was a very stupid attempt at some sort of Stranger Things esque 80's horror piece 
but falls flat on all fronts. Even the guides the game gives you are unhelpful and poorly designed. Worst of all, they
couldn't even take the time to give the game a proper icon (it uses the Unity logo) The game also boots out of Unity
which I find both sad and nonprofessional from a publisher like Devolver Digital. I do not recommend playing
or buying this game, even though it is cheap it is not worth your time.
