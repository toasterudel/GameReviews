Thoughts:
The game play loop in Doom is super tight. Never stop moving, shoot everything 
you see, and get in close for glory kills as much as possible.  This game play 
is what carries the game, even when it can sometimes break it because its just 
happening so fast (Found a few bugs that required a mission reload). The story 
was alright, nothing really interesting, and the run and gun sections could get 
repetitive from time to time but new enemies were introduced regularly which 
kept it fresh. They keep talking about how the Doom Marine is some revered monster 
of Hell and that only he can stop everything, but the game shows me that enough so 
the exposition can get a little dull. Finally, my only real complaint with the 
combat is sometimes you just really can't tell when health is low, and whenever 
I died it never felt fair, it always felt cheap or random.
