Thoughts:
The card game of the web. Honestly the best card game I've 
played in a while. Its easy to pick up, easy to stay 
competitive because its free, and overall uses the video game 
aspect to its advantage. Being able to have a constant stream 
of new players to battle with and access to almost every card 
for free turns it from a card game about buying the best cards 
to a card game about trying to find the best combination of them, 
which cant be said about the fast changing expensive meta games 
of Pokemon TCG and Magic the Gathering.
