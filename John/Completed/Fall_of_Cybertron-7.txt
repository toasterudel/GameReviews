Thoughts:
FoC's base mechanic of switching between vehicle and soldier is honestly the best depiction of Transformers in gaming. The fluid animation, the awesome
sounds and the scaling between different bots is really something to be proud of. The multiplayer was also always exciting, with medics 
flying in and out of hot zone, smaller cars zipping around like mice. The game had a very solid feel to it throughout the whole thing.
Plus the ending boss fight of Megatron vs Optimus was pretty amazing. My only complaints are the forced walking segments as well as some of the death animations on
soldiers. Sometimes they looked like 2D animations mapped to a small 3 cube to give the illusion of an actual in game render.
