Thoughts:
Gen 4 is honestly my favorite Pokemon generation. The Sinnoh region is easily one of my favorites, 
from the amazing underground mini game to the post game battle frontier. Something about it just 
really stuck out to me. The story was OK but the new Pokemon and the whole adventure was just so 
fun that it really stuck in my head.
