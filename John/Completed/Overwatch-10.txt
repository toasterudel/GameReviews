Thoughts: 
This is game is pretty much team based shooter perfection. 
Each character feels unique and handles differently, each level is unique 
and offers its own set of challenges for the characters. The music, 
the game play, the short films, and the dev team at Blizzard really make this game shine. 
They genuinely care about player feedback and actively move to change the game to what 
the community desires. Every time I play it feels like a fresh and fun experience 
and that it something that Blizzard has truly perfected as a studio.
