Thoughts:
One of the best DLCs of all time. Adding zombies to the RDR world, changing the 
tone/filter, and creating a new story within is an amazing feat for what DLC 
should be. The different zombie types were interesting and the undead horde 
survival was always fun to play. Also the amount of zombies on screen rivals 
that of dead rising and it was really a joy to play.
