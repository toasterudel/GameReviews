Thoughts:
Honestly this game is one that shouldn't have been made. The content is so stretched out to accodomadate the idea of putting one film into a game 
instead of a trilogy. Most of the unlockable characters are background characters ive never heard of, and that aren't even given names within the film.
The missions are fine and the multiple build options for each pile of legos is an interesting take on the existing formula. However, I also hate that there 
is no central hub. Unlocking characters to me is extremely complicated, having to find them at one of several outposts and then purchasing. I would have 
preffered if the game was more centralized in that aspect. Maybe if they come out with a 7-9 trilogy game that would be something I'd buy, but for now 
i'll skip the next few LEGO starwars games.
