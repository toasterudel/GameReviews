Thoughts:
From the ambient music, to the simplistic art style, Mini Metro is a charming indie experience. 
The slow pacing from the initial 3 stations to  a full map is amazing, and so well crafted 
that you don't even notice the map expanding until the game is over. This puzzle game is unique
and well executed and is definitely a great example of interesting ideas that indie devs can
explore.
