Thoughts:
A solid old school assassins creed title. While it is very obvious 
that it was confined by the last gen tech, its feels like a "greatest hits" 
for the last gen AC games. Even though the game was short, its main 
set pieces truly blew me away. The earthquake in Lisbon was such a 
powerful scene, escaping the city as it crumbles to the ground is an event 
that no other AC game has really attempted. Also the game play is highly 
reminiscent of Black Flag, which is a great thing. Tight combat and easy 
to use weapon wheels. Which brings me to the story, this game takes place during 
the events of AC3 and ACU, and it does so perfectly. Achilles and Haytham both 
have prominent roles within the campaign and the ending of the game times into 
ACU perfectly with the killing of Arno's father in Versailles. Overall this game 
was masterful in weaving its story into the other AC titles and will remain a 
favorite of mine in the series for quiet a while.
