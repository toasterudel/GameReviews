Thoughts:
The Titanfall 2 campaign is seriously a solid piece of content. The balance between 
free running puzzles combat, and titan game-play is extremely well done. My only 
problem with it is that the main campaign is only about 5 hours long, when I could've 
easily sat for double. Other than that though this game is truly fantastic with a solid 
multiplayer to back it up. It's a shame that it went rather under bought during its launch 
but I still believe it is one of the best future shooters of 2016. If not the best.
