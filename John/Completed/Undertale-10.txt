Thoughts:
That was an emotional roller coaster. The uphill battle of sparing everyone was a challenge 
but had a such a great pay off. The option to spare monsters instead of killing them is one 
that is a truly interesting concept and it is first done well here. Also the ending against 
ASGORE was phenomenally written, walking in and having brief chit chat, like the fight that 
was about to happen was really nothing personal, and to me that felt amazing. Something about 
the basic courtesy that ASGORE extends not only humanizes this demon that the game had made 
him out to be but is also super humbling. Easily the best indie game of 2015 and an instrumental 
game in breaking the tradition of violence in video games.
