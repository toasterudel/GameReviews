Thoughts:
After finally getting around to finishing Fallout, I can say that I'm glad I did. 
The main story wasn't really that great, and to be honest was pretty bad at certain parts. 
I did overall enjoy my experience. The exploration was fun, stumbling upon new things 
and vaults and adventures. I also really enjoyed the Brotherhood of Steel quest line. 
The factions other than the BoS felt underwhelming to me and while I originally joined 
the BoS for the power armor, I have to say it was also the most compelling narrative 
and reasoning behind a faction. (Most definitely helped by the fact that the BoS is in older games). 
Other than that I experienced many bugs and had to reload the game to past saves more 
than a handful of times which ultimately hamper my experience over all. However, 
it was still enjoyable and I'd probably recommend it to a friend given the right price.
