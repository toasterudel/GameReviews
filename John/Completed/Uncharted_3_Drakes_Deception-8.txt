Thoughts:
This installment of Uncharted builds perfectly upon the last two, taking what makes each one great and also coming 
into its own. The puzzles here are very well done, requiring thought and time to actually solve while not being overly 
complicated. The action sequences are high octane and the stealth options actually are possible now. I also found T.E Lawrence
and the City of Brass to be an awesome story line, which kept me hooked through the whole thing. From the awesome bar fight opener 
to the escape from Iram it felt like an epic cinematic experience. My only complaints would be that the combat can still sometimes 
be unbalanced and that their were very few puzzles towards the end of the game. (And maybe the desert walk dragged a little to long) 
Other than that though it was a great adventure and a fitting installment for the franchise.
