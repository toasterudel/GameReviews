Thoughts: 
The story is semi interesting as Sora travels the worlds in search of his friends, but everything is ultimately muddled by the gameplay and the main camera. 
Boss battles were way to hard and it was only exaggerated by the camera problems and janky controls. I also dislike that most actual narrative content 
is put at either to beginning or end of the story. However, the over all premise was fun and exploring the various worlds of disney is always super cool. 
Playing thru this game felt neccesary as a pilgramidge thru the KH franchise but as a standalone game its only slighlty above average when going back.
