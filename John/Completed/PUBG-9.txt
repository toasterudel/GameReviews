Thoughts:
PUBG is a tense and tactical battle royal game that really shot the genre into the lime light with gamers.
Every encounter is meaningful, with short adrenaline filled bursts of combat that burn memories into your mind.
The longer you play the more and more the map looks like a collection of short stories of things that happened 
at each location. Killed a whole squad here, got murdered point blank here, etc. I also realy enjoyed the loot crate 
system because I could sell things on the steam market, which basically recouped my entire cost for the game. 
Only major complaint is the cheater situation and how long it took them to get it under control, turned me off 
from the game for a long time as the top 10 never felt fair. Still a great game though, and probably my most 
played steam game to date.
