Thoughts:
Not the best for the borderlands franchise, but on its own it does 
rather well for itself as a sci-fi shooter. The pacing feels good, 
and the game gets better as it goes on, further diving into the 
sci-fi elements. However I found the comedy Borderlands is known for 
to be sparse, and the new characters didn't seem to have much personality 
to them. However, the game did a great job of fleshing out characters 
from Borderlands 1 and 2.  At times the game can feel like an all out slog 
when played alone, but the gun play and character abilities keep it 
interesting enough for me to enjoy at least 20 of the 23 hours I've sunk into the game.
