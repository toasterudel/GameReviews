Thoughts: 
A new take on Assassins creed. Great use of the new engine to 
maximize number of characters on screen but only truly realized 
during the battle of bunker hill. The tomahawk is an amazing 
weapon of choice even though the wielder (Connor) can be a little bland. 
The naval combat was also abysmal but definitely a great game with 
amazing historical prowess. On top of that the Tyranny of King George was 
an amazing game changer, adding spirit animal abilities and the whole 
alternate take on history. It was incredibly well done and added so much heart to the game.
