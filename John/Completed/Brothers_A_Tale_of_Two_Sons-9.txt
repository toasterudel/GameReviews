Thoughts:
Such powerful condensed story telling. This game is proof of quality over 
quantity, a game that doesn't even have words managed to bring an epic tale 
of brotherhood and adventure to life. Easily my favorite short form game to date. 
The puzzles are rather easy but the innovative use of the controls and the 
amazing atmosphere and set pieces easily make up for this. Just such a solid 
title, hilariously well made game from the people at Starbreeze.
