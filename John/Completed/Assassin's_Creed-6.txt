Thoughts:
The games freedom when it comes to assassinating targets is interesting and it's 
use of the in game camera instead of more cinematic angles is well done, but the 
repetitive nature of each kill leaves the much to be desired. The Kingdom zone also 
has legitimately zero importance other than a time waster throughout the campaign. 
The story is probably the games greatest asset, paving the way for the rest of the 
Assassins Creed universe, but the formula wouldn't be properly executed  until AC2.
