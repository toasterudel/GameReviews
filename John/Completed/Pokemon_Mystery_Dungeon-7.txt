Thoughts:
This is the only Mystery Dungeon I enjoyed. Something about the story really stuck out to me 
as it dealt with more mature concepts then Pokemon usually does like betrayal, framing others, 
and death. The levels were interesting and the game play was a good time waster back when I 
was a kid. My major complaint is that it was impossible to evolve without going to a post game 
temple, simply letting Pokemon evolve at the proper level would've made more sense.
