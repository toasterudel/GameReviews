Thoughts:
The game is driven by its story through and through. The character development of Booker and Elizabeth as their relationship grows 
is comparable to the Last of Us in terms of story telling, and while not as gripping, provides a fun and interesting experience.
The narrative had me hooked at the start, a dystopian post civil war city floating in the cloud. That's insane! I also enjoy
how it didnt stray away from tough ideas like that of racism or prejudice of different ideas. It made the world feel uncomfortable to
be in, which really helps add to the immersion of the game. Unfortunately the gameplay became rather stale after the first few hours 
of the game. While the rail system was fun at first, ultimately it is hard to control and even harder to shoot off of, often becoming 
a simple escape tool rather than an emergent part of the gameplay. Gunplay was generic but satisfying when paired with abilities like 
electrocution on headshots, etc. The Vigors system was also kind of lack luster. Even though there were around 8 abilities I only found 
myself using 2 or 3 the entire game, as each one has basically the same premise (click to do attack, hold to set trap version). Overall 
I think this is a great game for anyone who is interesting in alternate universe stories or multi-dimension sci-fi tales, the combat might 
leave something to be desired but ultimately it's story helps to overlook those faults.
