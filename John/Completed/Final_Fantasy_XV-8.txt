Thoughts:
The story of brotherhood and the epic scale of the gods and combat are what really carry 
this game to sure amazing heights.  Nothing is more satisfying than warping between enemies 
and summoning the might of the gods against a boss. While sometimes the combat can be 
hindered by the level difference between characters overall its an enjoyable experience. 
The world is also so well built with interesting scenarios throughout and a lore that would 
be hard pressed to find a rival. Story is also pretty well done but has several small awkward 
moments with random things or actions happening without much lead up or explanation 
(Gladio randomly leaving the party for example). However, the game easily overcomes 
its faults and was fun to play all the way through.
