Thoughts:
Easily the best heist game I've played to date. The early versions of this game were solid and 
had interesting missions and a fun and easy to understand leveling and loot system. However, 
as time went on this game got worse and worse. Now there is over 100+ individual DLC packs 
for this game and each one adds something that should either be free or not in the game. 
These DLC packs ruined the experience for me and honestly turned the games systems into an 
over crowded cluster fuck. Still though I did enjoy my time with the game a lot and would 
probably play it again somewhere down the line.
