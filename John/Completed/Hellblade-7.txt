Thoughts:
While the primary draw of this game is definitely for its interesting take of menal illness, I found 
the Norse mythology to actually be the most compelling part. Something about fighting the gods and 
learning more about their history really spoke to me in a way most games don't, as most games have 
more fictionalized dieties instead of real world ones. The narrative I thought was ok, mostly it was 
muddled by pacing. The game would have long puzzle sequences, then a long battle, then a long 5+ minute 
cutscene. While none of this was awful I think the game would have benefited from everything being a bit 
more broken up and woven in a more organic way.
