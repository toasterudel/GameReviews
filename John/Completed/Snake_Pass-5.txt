Thoughts: 
The mechanics in snake pass are interesting, using the snake actually feels realistic and unique moving back and forth. 
However, being an actual snake is rather hard, I found myself dying to the stupidest things constantly as controlling 
a snake is no easy task. Also while I appreciate the collectathon, the story was extremely subpar. I also did not 
enjoy the fire and Wind levels, I felt as though the water and earth worlds were much more unique and interesting to explore.
