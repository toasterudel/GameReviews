Thoughts:
Even though this game is incredibly short, the depth it brings to the table is truly astonishing. These intricate puzzle boxes are truly something to behold,
involving such high technical skill to create from a design perspective it almost hard to imagine the work that goes in
on the design side behind the scenes. The puzzles are just the right difficulty as well, I only had to get hints less then a hand full of times.
