Thoughts:
This game excels based on what the first game had to offer. 
Not only does it bring back all the original playable characters 
and adds them to the cast, but also introduces one of the most 
memorable villains in recent gaming, Handsome Jack. This game 
is equally as funny as its predecessor. However, somewhere along 
the way it lost the original Borderlands feel. It might be in the 
deeper analysis of its main characters over the course of the game, 
or maybe its just a strange nostalgia for the original level design 
of the desert landscapes in the first game. Either way definitely 
not as enjoyable as the first, but a worthy sequel non the less.
