Thoughts:
Downgrade from Black Flag. The story was weak and predictable, boring overall. 
The combat system was completely destroyed in the process of making the games 4 player online. 
Its only saving graces are the Co-op and the parkour. They brought in actual free runners to 
do the motion capture so it looked amazing. Also Revolutionary France was fantastic. 
The story was rushed and unclear. An easily forgettable experience.
