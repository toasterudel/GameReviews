Thoughts:
For a sequel to the horror classic Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this game is really so much worse.
They stripped away all the major features that made the first game scary, they removed lamp fluid, 
an inventory system, and basically any semblance of actual monsters. The monsters in this game do not 
chase, they don't even really do anything. I feel like you can walk past them all with pretty much 
not reprecussion. While the first game was a puzzle horror title, this is little more than an eerie
walking simulator. It's only saving grace is an interesting narrative that discusses the idea of trying to
save the world from visions the main character has. (Visions of WW1 and WW2, which he views as the end of time)
If you played the first Amnesia, I would not recommend this game. It's not scary at all and nowhere near the quality 
of the first one. Just play the OG instead.
