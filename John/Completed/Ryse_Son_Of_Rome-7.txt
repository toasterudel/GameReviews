Thoughts:
Rome is one of the most interesting parts of human history to me and this game does a 
great job at its delivery of the Roman experience. The architecture and grandiose 
coliseums are really an amazing thing to behold in the Crytek engine.  Unfortunately 
however, the enemy design does not fare as well as the art direction. The enemies are 
grouped into 3 main categories which each have a distinct button combo to kill, this 
brings the game into a very repetitive game flow that rarely allows for intuitive combat 
scenarios. The story was fine however I think it could do without the "gods" controlling 
everything from behind the scenes, it suffers much in the way that Assassins Creed 
suffers from the Over world and the Animus.
