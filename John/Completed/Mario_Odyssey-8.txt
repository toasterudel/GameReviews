Thoughts:
Mario Odyssey is a fun, well designed collectathon that really is a treat to play from beginning to end. 
The controls, while not as tight as I would like on the Joy-Cons, are quite enjoyable and Mario has an 
incredible range of moves that allow for a lot of great options traversing the world. The moons are also
for the most part well done, with each being interesting to find and rewarding. The story, like every Mario game,
left a bit to be desired, but nothing particulary wrong with it. My only real gripe is the amount of content in the game
vs the amount of content needed to beat the game. I ended the base game with around 200 moons, a rather generous amount
compared to the minimum you need to complete the game (I believe around 120). Yet, the full game itself has over 800 unique
moons, and 999 as the actual maximum. I just think it would have made more sense to at least make the cap 300 to beat the game, but
I understand limiting it to a small number for completetion to allow worlds to not grow stale over time.
