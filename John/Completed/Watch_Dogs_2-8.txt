Thoughts:
Watch_Dogs is a series that has massive trouble getting its act together. Watch Dogs 2 
is a massive departure from Watch Dogs 1, relying more on the fun hacker/hipster culture 
instead of a darker more punk vibe. Watch Dogs 2 also improves on stealth options with the 
RC and drone, and has  a variety of ways to tackle each mission. Its downfalls though are 
in its poor story telling and it's lack of compelling characters.
