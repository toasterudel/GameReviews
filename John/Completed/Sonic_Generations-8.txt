Thoughts:
A compilation of the history of sonic games, a "best of" for the franchise. The game does 
extremely well remastered the older games and giving new Sonic a fresh take with seamless 
transitions from 3D to 2D segments that honestly should be a new staple for the franchise. 
Each mission feels fresh while also sticking to the source material of each game. The game 
only suffers once it enters sonic '06, Unleashed, and colors, which one can say is low for 
the series in general. Unfortunately a game once broken, cannot usually be fixed.
