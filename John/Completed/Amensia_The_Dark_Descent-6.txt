Thoughts:
The story and atmosphere of Amnesia are well done. Going deeper and deeper into the decaying 
castle as monsters begin to flood the halls and walls collapse creates a very eary atmosphere. 
Being only able to run from monsters is a little annoying, at least killing one, even for story 
could have been fun to do. However, this game is a pretty quick horror title that I used as a break 
between more serious long form games, and it happily served its purpose. If you're looking for a quick 
scare fest or just something to take a break from all the more heavy AAA titles, give this a shot.
