Thoughts:
An excellent game of satirical writing and plat former combat. My only major 
complaint is that the game is too short. From beginning to end though the game 
is a fantastic joy ride with colorful planets and interesting characters to 
interact with. The worlds could have been fleshed out a little more but the 
big cluster of planets they allow you to visit was really something else.
