Thoughts:
A charming 2D farming simulator that I can not get enough of. Inspired by older titles like 
Harvest Moon, Stardew really comes into its own by adding tons of extra features such as mining, 
as well as deep and meaningful NPC interactions that some AAA games have trouble matching. The game can 
feel a bit micromanagement as you attempt to plan out everyday with the limited time and stamina you have, 
but a lot of the fun comes in planning everything you're going to do days in advance. This endless cycle makes 
it pretty hard to put down, as you've planned so many days in advance and you just need to finish the thought 
before logging out. Maybe the seasons could have been shorter as I don't believe 20 hours will even complete 
a full year in game, but this is a small gripe. Honestly once the multiplayer comes out I think this will be 
a near perfect game for people who love farming games and the hospitality and heart the game really offers.
