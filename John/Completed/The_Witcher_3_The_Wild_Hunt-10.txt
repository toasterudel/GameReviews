Thoughts:
The greatest game I have ever played. The story has moved me in ways I thought at times not 
capable of a game, from the laughter of dealing with romance to the genocide of non-humans 
that now bears solely on my shoulders. The game ending with Redania conquering the north, 
the fate of all non-humans hindered on a quest I knew I should have done but I did not. 
When I finished the game the genocide of the non-humans haunted me, and that is such an 
amazing feeling from a game that I will not soon forget. I shaped Geralt through my actions, 
we became one and I felt as if he were an extension of me just as his blades to him. I digress, 
smooth game play, tight controls, amazing art direction, incredible game design, masterful 
story telling. My only regret is that I let Radovid live. If another game ever arises following 
this I will replay the entire thing once more, if not only to sever the serpents head from its body.
