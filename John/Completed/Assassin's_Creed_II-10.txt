Thoughts: 
Amazing story full of rich history and character development. 
One of the best coming of age stories I've played. Great easy 
to pick up combat as well as an amazing parkour system. The peaceful 
nature of the time period allowed a lot of focus to actually be placed 
on the Assassins themselves and their fight against the Templars. 
Also the out of Animus scenes were well done and only used when necessary. 
Overall the game was an absolute treasure and a privilege to have played.
