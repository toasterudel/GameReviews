Thoughts:
While the narrative direction and tone of this game are fantastic, but 
the game play isn't as engaging as I would've liked. The combat system felt 
a little clunky and getting into cover wasn't always perfect. 
( The game could have been helped by a better cover system like that in Gears)  
However, where the game play does succeed is in its crafting system. Though it is 
very small in the amount of items craftable, the combinations of items to make certain 
things often means making heavy decisions between med-kits or moltovs, shivs or bombs. 
These choices to me are an excellent push towards the desperation and lack of resources the game tries to create.
