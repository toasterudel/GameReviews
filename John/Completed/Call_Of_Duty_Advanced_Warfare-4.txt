Thoughts:
For Sledgehammers first official Call of Duty game, this showed promise. 
However, not even adding Kevin Spacey as the main antagonist could save 
this game from the disaster it became. The campaign felt weak and underdeveloped 
in several places. Other then Spacey the characters were forgettable and the story 
itself was a little lack luster. One of the worst moments was a woman in a 
military grade exo suit being overpowered by a normal thug off the street, 
the game spends so much time emphasizing the importance of how powerful these 
suits are so throwing that in there makes no sense. Yet even with all the campaigns 
massive shortcomings, the multiplayer is what really sinks this game. Humans think 
horizontally, our eyes are made with peripherals to the left and right, yet Advanced 
Warfare used a vertical design scheme for their maps. While this design choice helps 
to accent the new boosting mechanic, it creates a higher ground combat scheme that makes 
it hard for underdogs to recover from. Also the fact that stat changed weapons can 
be found in supply crates is both unbalanced and obnoxious.
