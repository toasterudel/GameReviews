Thoughts:
Console Pokemon games are too far and in between. This game, even though you could 
not catch Pokemon in the normal way, had such a solid base in its battle system that 
really kept it going the entire time. It's punk rock ascetic was also super cool, 
with its underground cities and desert/oasis locals. Plus the giant battle volcano was 
so fun and catching Raiku at the top is really an unforgettable experience.
