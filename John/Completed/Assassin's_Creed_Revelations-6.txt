Thoughts:
A downgrade from Brotherhood but a fitting end to the Ezio Trilogy. 
Yuesef was a fantastic character and the underground templar city was incredible. 
Something about it just wasnt the same though, whether it be the new approach 
to missions, the bombs and hook blade, or maybe Ezio had just become to old, 
but it lost the spark that made ezio so special. Still a good game though.
