Thoughts:
So close to being great. The whole game struggles with pacing issues throughout, but when it does take off it soars. 
Starrik is an awesome bad guy and the interplay between the Frye Twins and him is fun to watch. Like the end scene 
with Starrik and Evie dancing was great. The combat is fun and fast paced but I do wish they would add the weapon 
wheel back for more variety. Also the scenes in reality were relatively weak until the end which was unfortunate 
and it had pretty bad voice acting for Shuan's character. My biggest gripe though is there is no consequence for 
Jacob and Evie going rogue and disobeying the direct orders of the assassin council by fleeing to London. 
The opening sequence clearly states they are going against the councils wishes and even Mr. Green 
doesn't know they are breaking the rules. It would have made for such a great climax breaker if they just 
had the master assassins step in and try Evie and Jacob for their misconduct. Either way it was a step in 
the right direction and I hope it paves the way for more assassins creed games to come.
