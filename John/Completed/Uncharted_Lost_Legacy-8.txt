Thoughts:
While not as long or engaging as Uncharted 4, Lost Legacy provides a rewarding narrative and a strong set of female protagonists that really make this game stand out.
Visually the game is a master piece with beautiful vistas and a rich indian culture that splashes some rich colors into the Uncharted pallette. 
The story of hunting the Tusk of Ganesh is probably one of the more engaging tales uncharted has tackled, really bringing me into the lore and Hindu culture.
The final boss was also one of the best in the game, going for a cinematic fist fight rather then a one of gimmick that usually doesn't work. I wish
it was a little bit longer, but for $40 its really a solid release for the price range.
