Thoughts:
Such promise...such pain... Destiny was a lie. Honestly I've seen tighter 
campaigns from Call of Duty games which is sad from a Bungie title. The story 
was short, hard to follow, and forgettable. The honest only saving grace 
was the super fun and amazingly tight gun play and combat that kept me hooked 
for an amount of time I feel embarrassed to divulge.
