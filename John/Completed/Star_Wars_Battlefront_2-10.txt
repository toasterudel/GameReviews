Thoughts:
Battlefront II is a perfect game. With an excellent story following the plot 
of the clone wars it honestly is just a solid depiction of what Star Wars is like. 
The combat is solid and every class feels good to play. On top of that the ground 
to air combat and vehicles are the highlight of this game and really give me a 
sense of wonder every time I play.
