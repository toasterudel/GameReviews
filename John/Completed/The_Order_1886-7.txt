Thoughts:
The camera angles in this game are easily it's best feature. The way the camera 
follows the player in and out of cover feels more akin to a movie or cut scene 
than to actual gameplay and really enhances the experience. The combat is also well 
cone with pretty tight gun play, a solid variety of weapons, and a decent cover system 
that works in most cases. The only downside to this game is the story beats. The premise 
and world behind it (Knights of King Arthur who found the Holy Grail and defend the 
world for all time against evil demons) are so interesting. Even adding in real characters 
like Nikola Tesla and The Marquis de Lafayette were super cool and well done. 
However, the way they present the story tries to hide the purpose of The Order and how it 
functions in so much mystery when they should really be focusing on the shrouding the villains 
in that cloak. With a longer campaign and maybe a prologue of them founding The Order I think 
this game could have ended up as a mainstay series for PlayStation, but alas it missed its 
target by just a fraction of an inch and thus I don't think it will continue.
