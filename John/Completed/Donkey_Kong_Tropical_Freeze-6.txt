Thoughts:
Asthetically this game is beautiful. The animation and art combine with the music to create the best 
looking Donkey Kong experience I've ever seen. However, this game is far from perfect and its 
platforming is not only hard in its own right, but also poorly designed. The amount of times I missed 
jumps, hit a random wall, or died from going to fast is uncanny. The game suffers from many of the same 
platforming mistakes as sonic, with awful pacing and design the contradicts itself. For example, some levels 
have sections where you are required to run as fast as possible to escape some sort of obstacle to the left screen, 
but then at the end of the section it immediately hits you with jumping sections in which you have to wait for propper 
timing that isn't synced with when you approached it. Why would you want a player you asked to go at max speed to stop 
cold turkey without even so much as a barrel shift? Some of the placement of platforms and enemies just boggles my mind. 
The best levels are by far the mine cart levels as you have some fun jetting between 2D and 2.5D spaces. Yet the worst levels 
are the underwater levels and the rocket barrel levels. Both control like utter garbage and left me feeling more angry than 
anything. If you like hard games or perfection platformers than this is probably a great game for you, but as a 
casual of the 2D platforming genre, I don't think it has the gameplay to reach a wider audience.
