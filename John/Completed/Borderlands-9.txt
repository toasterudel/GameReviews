Thoughts:
Borderlands brought a couple of things to the FPS genre back in the day. 
It invited people into a cell shaded world of a billion and one guns and 
the very "No fucks given" attitude of the planet Pandora. Borderlands has 
a hilarious approach to story telling and creates a rather memorable cast 
of characters based on costume design alone. Yet, what makes Borderlands the 
most memorable for me is that the lack of character detail allowed me to fill 
in the world with my own stories. Sweeping abandon towns with some Sniper rifle 
wielding friends became a fun and engaging spec ops experience, molding our similar 
characters to what we wanted them to be, and that's what made the game so great.
