Thoughts:
Basically just a giant Pokemon bank, but it did have some upsides. 
Looking around at all the Pokemon in 3d and tossing them toys was kind 
of fun, plus it gave out free Pokemon once a week. Other than that 
though game play was non-existent and its almost hard to really call it a game at all.
