Thoughts:
A perfected sequel to the amazing Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War takes the mechanics of the first game and brings them to new heights. Reworked running
and the double jump make movement faster and more fluid. The new gear options feel welcome and not like some sort of overbearing cash grab. The new fortress 
and siege modes feel like the perfect extension of the nemesis system, however the game does have some flaws. The story is decent, not really existing except 
for the opening and closing expositions, though I found those quite entertaining. The game could also sometimes enter a highly repetetive state where all 
your doing is dominating orc captains one by one to build your army, or when the same orc returns from the dead 5 times in a row to haunt you. The main 
repetetive fall is the Shadow Wars at the end, honestly I'm suprised they didn't roll the credits at the end of act 3 because I genuinely believe nobody is 
playing all of the Shadow War to get the true ending. Especially when the Shadow War is described as an "infinite stalemate". I did like the true ending though
and its direct tie ins to how the LoTR starts.
