Thoughts:
The story and art style are about the only saving graces this game has. The 60's asthetic is pretty cool, and
ages suprisingly well. The story takes a pretty interesting look at mental health, while also managing to 
maintain a fun and peppy atmosphere throughout. The main problems on my end come from the terribly ages combat 
and camera options. Honestly, even Battle for Bikini Bottom has aged better than this game. The platforming is 
janky at best and the game asks for so many different abilities all the time without ever specifying when they are 
actually supposed to be used. Overall this led to me consulting online guides about 20+ times throughout the experience
which is never something I should have to do. I played this game solely because it is an important historical piece 
in the gaming medium, but if I were to recommend it to a casual player or even a hardcore gamer, I would ask them to stay 
away or watch a play through instead.
