Thoughts:
A worthy sequel to the original Mirror's Edge offering fast paced parkour 
and puzzle solving. My only big complaint is the linear feeling of the open world. 
Now while they most likely did this to avoid loading screens, it get quite 
repetitive during the game. Most major areas can only be accessed at one location 
leading to huge detours just to get to the other side of a street. Overall though 
the characters were fun and the Parkour was solid. Definitely a solid game for the series.
