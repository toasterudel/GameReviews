Thoughts:
Tim Schafer's unique art direction and comedic stylings are the only things really keeping this 
game afloat for me. The 60's inspired art just like in psychonauts is a great experience, and the 
papercraft esque feel here is also interesting for a 2D game. Honestly though the best part of this 
game is probably its stellar voice cast (Whil Wheaton, Elijah Wood, etc.). The game itself though is
honestly sub par. I found the story to be rather shallow, with the narrative only really scratching 
the surface of what is actually going on in the world. On top of this the gameplay is pretty awful. 
I genuinely don't believe in any scenario would I have figured out the puzzles in this game without 
the use of a guide. Without a guide I think it would have quadrupled my game time if not indefinitely.
