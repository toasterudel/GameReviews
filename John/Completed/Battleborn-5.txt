Thoughts:
This game is just a nice feeling bullet sponge. The story was irrelevant 
but the game play was reminiscent of Borderlands and could carry me through 
the campaign. Honestly it was just soaking bullets into semi interesting enemies. 
I liked the animated intro and end game scenes though. I felt they were smart 
and on budget with the money they probably had to spend. The characters are also 
kind of interesting, but the borderlands style comedy they tried to weave into 
it hurt some characters and made the game feel more cheesy then serious.
