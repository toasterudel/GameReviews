Thoughts:
The story of Injustice is decent for the alternate universe story they were working with. 
However, where this game really exceeds is in its true to character combat mechanics. 
Each character feels unique and has a play style that suits the actual comic book versions 
of the character. Green Arrow feels like a true archer with a variety of arrows at his 
disposal. Aqua Man actually feels like king of Atlantis! What they have done with the 
characters is truly an exciting feat, plus the super moves are an awesome way to 
accentuate the characters special abilities.
