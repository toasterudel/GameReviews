Thoughts:
Perfect blend of fast paced parkour action and mech warfare. The games was 
balanced extremely well between mech and infantry combat. There was no story mode, 
but that wasn't really a problem. My real problem was the attempt to add a story 
in without a story mode, there obviously wasn't enough time to add a decent story 
in between multiplayer matches so the attempt to do so just fell flat. I thought it 
was amazing for what it was, but it just didn't have the weight to hold up through time.
Side Note: Respawn is an amazing company giving all the DLC out for free one year 
after the initial launch of the game. Just Sayin'.
