Thoughts:

Horizon is easily a contender for game of the year 2017. This game is fantastic, which is suprising coming from the people 
who made Killzone: Shadow Fall (A game I ultimately found to be painfully average). From the diverse biomes to the even more 
diverse robots to fight the game is constantly suprising me at every turn. Each robot has a myriad of ways to take it down 
and with so many weapons at your disposal the options given to tackle any one creature is astonishing. On top of the amazing 
enemy design though lies an amazing narrative that had me hooked for the entire game, and an immersive world of strange tribes 
and customs that kept me looking deeper and deeper into side content to figure out the motives and reasonings behind each tribe.
The scale of the game and the topics it cover are awe inspiring, weaving such a heavy narrative of collapse, climate change, killer AI,
cults, and so much more I genuinely cannot wait for a sequel. The villians motivations were sound and the set up for the second game 
literally has me on the edge of my seat for what comes next. Brilliant game, can't praise it enough.
