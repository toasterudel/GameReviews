Thoughts:
The Guardians of the Galaxy game is an interesting look into the backstories of each guardian, and what it truly means 
to be a team. Using the Eternity Forge and Mantis as a plot device to go deep into every characters psyche was pretty 
awesome. Reliving each major life changing memory was a useful way to understand each character, and the banter between 
everyone was pretty solid. Mantis was also handled much better in this than in the MCU, which actually makes me 
enjoy the character much more. Some of the story telling falls flat in places but ultimately it was an enjoyable 
experience and a more fitting story about Peter Quills family and his relationship to his parents then Guardians 2 will ever be.
