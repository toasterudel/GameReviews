Thoughts:
Great concept to traverse the RPG genre and watch it grow and evolve as the game progresses. 
However, this game doesn't do a very good job of actually applying the concept to a game form. 
While sticking true in a sense to the random encounters of old RPGs, the amount of times random 
encounters occur in the over world is insane! Every 3 steps another battle would happen which 
ultimately did nothing at all. Also the variety was pretty weak only revolving around either a 
top down hack and slash or a turn based combat system. Brilliant idea, poor execution.
