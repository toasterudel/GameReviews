Thoughts:
GameFreak really out did themselves with this remake. The sprites and animations 
were amazing. My personal favorite part of this game is the ability to have Pokemon 
follow you, which is just so amazing and will probably never be seen again. This is 
also the game in which they added the PokeWalker which was a little pedometer that 
would help Pokemon find items and level up. It wasn't super fun but the game more 
than made up for it.
