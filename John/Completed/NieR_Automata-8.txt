Thoughts:
While the base mechanics can become somewhat repetetive after a few hours of play, the strange game
design decisions this game makes are what really stand out. The camera angle shifts are usually well done
and interesting, and the idea of multiple endings and storylines is cool, although I think it was a mistake 
to tell people the game was over after part A, if the Devs know that the actual ending is locked behind 
part E. If someone just played part A i genuinely think they would be dissapointed and feel jipped out of 
$60. The final choice of the game though I think is very interesting and speaks to some of the main 
points of the game. Without going into to much spoilers, the game asks you to do something actually 
selfless, which in games is usually mundane or faked, but here I found it to be a genuine and interesting 
approach to asking players to really do something different and make a difference in someone elses experience.
For anybody interesting in unique approaches to game design, this is for you, for anyone interested in
shoot em' ups, this game is 100% for you. It is hard at times though as the level curve can be janky at times.
However, stick through it, Im routing for you. Good Luck, Have Fun.
