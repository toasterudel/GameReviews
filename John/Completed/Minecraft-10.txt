Thoughts:
Few games can ever truly encapsulate what Minecraft achieved. 
Its instilled wonder, joy, sadness, and almost every other 
emotion possible in a game that doesn't even have a story. 
(At least it didn't while I played it) The open sandbox and 
the easy to sue multiplayer made it an amazing game, having 
to explore caves and fight creatures to survive and build homes 
was fun, and the redstone was so in depth that even today the 
inventions made simply amaze me. Unfortunately I think the game 
strayed a lot from its original wonder and simplicity so the newer updates 
actually bumped me out of playing. However, Minecraft in its prime (Beta 1.7) 
will always have a special place in my heart as one of the best games I've ever played.
