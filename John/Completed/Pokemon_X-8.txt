Thoughts:
This is the Pokemon game that got me into competitive battling. With the introduction 
of the fairy typing and shiny chaining the meta really changed into something that I 
wanted to be apart of. The end game was non-existent so playing into the competitive 
scene also helped to extend this games lifespan for me long beyond its normal time.
