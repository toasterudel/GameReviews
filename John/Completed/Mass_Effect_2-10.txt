Thoughts:
The character focused narrative of Mass Effect 2 is easily one of the best I've ever seen. 
Each character has their own unique personality, and missions that flesh them out as people 
while also building the world as a whole. The SciFi feel of Mass Effects universe is perfectly complimented 
by the moral quandries the game asks the player to answer, whether it be discovering the truth about 
a species (like the geth through Legion) or by joining Cerberus to fight the Collector threat. The combat is great 
with each squad member feeling like a contribution rather than a hinderance, and the dialogue options give a decent 
amount of wiggle room to figure out your Shepards personality. I personally found the Paragon content to be very 
rewarding, making me feel like a hero of the galaxy. Also all the small carry overs from Mass Effect 1 were subtle, 
but very appreciated. It helps build the idea that my characters made a difference in the universe.
