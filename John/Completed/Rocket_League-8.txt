Thoughts:
What a game! Having cars play soccer is honestly one of the most creative things 
to happen to e sports in a while. Rocket League has an easy learning curve with 
an epic skill cap that keeps players practicing and learning new tricks. 
Car mechanics and ball physics are tight and the creative maps and game modes 
always keep me occupied when the normal car soccer inst enough. Plus the soundtrack, 
the soundtrack is one of the greatest, most high octane edm music in any game and 
it really sets the tone for the soccer car-Apocalypse that usually goes down.
