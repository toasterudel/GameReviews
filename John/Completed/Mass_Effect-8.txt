Thoughts:
The game play is pretty rough to start, useless maps and a useless tactical system get 
in the way, but once the game opens up the worlds and gun play are super exciting. 
However, the narrative is what really drives this game. Everything about it from the world 
building to the characterization, to the choices the player made. Every moment had impact 
and resonated on the galactic scale the game wishes to achieve. Also the amazing plot twist 
from the Prothean AI on Ilos was an amazing moment that actually had me freaking out and 
screaming in my seat. Such an amazing game to set up the trilogy and it makes me eager 
to play the next 2 installments.
