Thoughts:
Uncharted 4 is good, the world is beautiful, the writing is top notch, and the puzzles and combat are spot on. 
Every character felt fleshed out and like they all got enough time to really let players understand them. 
I think the villians are great and the final sword fight was a fitting final battle. The narrative of Avery's 
treasure had me interested throughout the whole game, and ultimately was one of the more interesting plot hooks for the series. 
Bringing in the dynamics of Nate and Elana as they struggle with retirement and their love of adventure was a smart move on the writers part.
My only complaints would come probably from the open world sections of the game, which were fine, but overall kind of 
pointless. There weren't many enemies in the non-story parts of these locals so it was just kind of wandering until 
you found what the campaign wanted you to find to put you back on track. When there were enemies though, the game felt alive and 
interesting with multiple ways to tackle every situation. Whether it be stealth, melee or shooting the combat felt fluid and carried 
the game when the puzzles were far between.
