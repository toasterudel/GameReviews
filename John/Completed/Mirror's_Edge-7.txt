Thoughts:
Beautifully crafted game. The idea of a first person parkour game is innovative 
and well executed by DICE. While the story wasn't exactly perfect I think the music 
and the amount of variation in the courses really made the free running experience 
organic in a way that hasn't been copied since. Also when running time trials against 
friends it becomes a great competitive game, trying to balance tricks with speed to 
show off. Combines two of my favorite things, parkour and video games, and that's 
why it will always be an amazing game in my heart.
