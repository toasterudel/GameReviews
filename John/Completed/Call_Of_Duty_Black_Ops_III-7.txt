Thoughts:
This game is definitely the biggest Call of Duty to date.  Two campaigns 
(one normal, one zombie), a great solid zombies mode, and a balanced 
multiplayer. The multiplayer is very reminiscent of Black Ops 2 in gun 
play, but introduces a revamped 3D movement system that puts the advanced 
warfare game to shame. Unfortunately something did carry over from 
Advanced Warfare, stat changing weapons found in supply drops. They weren't 
in at launch, but they fundamentally change the game and have definitely 
dropped the longevity of this game a few months.
