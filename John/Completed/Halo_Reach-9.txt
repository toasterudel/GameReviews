Thoughts:
One of the best games I've ever played. Bungie's final good game, their last 
shot at the Halo franchise. Now I'm not gonna lie, the campaign had a few kinks 
with silly characters deaths (Mainly Kat) but overall the story was fun and 
well developed. Flying over New Alexandria and especially the final mission 
(Lone Wolf) will forever be ingrained into my head. Multiplayer wise this game got 
even better, the core maps were well thought out, symmetrical, and had a variety 
of game modes available on each. The core Slayer game mode had tight gun play 
and a great emphasis on player skill that is hard to match even today. Also Invasion 
was an actual game mode with dedicated maps that was a fun and intuitive game mode 
to play. I played this game for 3 years and I have to say the reason I stayed was the 
amazing gameplay in Slayer 4v4 and the best forge world Halo has scene. The Forge 
Map was huge and had tons and tons of game modes (Found through a working Bungie file share system) 
that kept the game alive forever. If I didn't sell my Xbox 360 
I would probably still be playing to this day.
