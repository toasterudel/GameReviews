Thoughts: A complete revamp of the series. Excellent setting, combat, story, graphics, 
everything was absolutely stunning. The naval combat was stellar and easy to control. 
The story about the assassins progressed so far, and the over world tie ins to other 
games like Watch_Dogs and Far cry are a nice touch to give the whole ubisoft universe color.  
The story even without the assassins and templars was still a beautiful pirate tale. 
When Anne starts singing and Edward meets his kid for the first time, gets me 
right in the honey nut feelios, every time.
