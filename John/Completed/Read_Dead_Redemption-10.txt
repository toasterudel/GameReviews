Thoughts:
Absolute Master Piece. The story of John Marston was one a trial and intrigue 
and I enjoyed the whole thing. It did have its short comings, a slow start and 
a pointless sex scene, but the rest of the game more than makes up for it. 
Tight gunplay, expansive world. Plus the ending with Jacks redemption of 
his father was really a great emotional ending.
