Thoughts:
A very ambitious game that tried to merge film and video game into a single experience. 
However, its attempt falls flat. The gameplay is weak, its a cover shooter without a 
cover system which is extremely aggravating to work with and play around. Its only saving 
grace is the interesting time warp mechanics that allow the player to move faster around 
the map. The TV show was also a major low point, it felt very forced and separate from the 
main game, and the actual control the player had on it was given through "Junction Points", 
which felt very disjointed from the main game itself. Also they had Sean Ashmore, 
an amazing actor, and then decide not to use him  expect for maybe 2 minutes of film content. 
Overall this game was made of poor decisions with the assets they were given and ultimately 
it falters where it could have stood tall above the rest.
