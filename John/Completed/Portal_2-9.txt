Thoughts:
Another short and beautiful experience from Valve.  Wheatly was an amazing 
friend/ enemy with witty banter. The plot was also excellent, diving into 
the early stages of Apeture and really digging into the lore or the series. 
Also the mechanics including the gel and gravity shifts was amazing, 
Overall great game, provocative in both mind games mechanics and dialogue. Perfect Sequel.
