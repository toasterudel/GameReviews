Thoughts:
The game definitely has some aging issues as most older games do over the years. However, 
after settling into the fixed frame rate (30) and floaty mouse controls the game really 
comes alive. The combat, while difficult with the mouse problems, is fun and exhilarating 
with each weapon offering unique secondary fire modes and ways to solve problems. The enemy 
design is also well thought out and chopping off monster limbs is a highlight of the game.
Story wise, the characters themselves are somewhat bland and undefined, but the ship 
the game takes place on (The USG Ishimura) is really a fleshed out and vibrant being within itself. 
The game offers some metroidvania esque backtracking, this mixed with writing on the walls and creatures 
coming and going throughout the ship really makes the ship feel memorable. Nothing is scarier 
than re-entering a room of dead necromorphs only to realize not all of them are actually dead.
I look forward to playing the next one, and while I would not recommend it to anyone looking for 
a modern AAA experience, I think it is definitely worth checking out if interested.
