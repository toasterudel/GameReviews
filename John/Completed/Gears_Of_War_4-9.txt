Thoughts:
This is what the Gears franchise needed! The game play was fresh 
and the enemy types and mission variation kept me hooked from 
start to finish. Playing in COOP it was fun to move through the 
tight corridors and open expanses while constantly freaking out 
because the new enemy type is scary AF. The characters also were 
full of banter and sarcasm that really helped to drive the 
overall characterization of the newcomers and really add to the plot 
of the Gears Universe. The campaign was a joy to play and it leaves 
players eager to see what The Coalition has in store for Gears in the future.
