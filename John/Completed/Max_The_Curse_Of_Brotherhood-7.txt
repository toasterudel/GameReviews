Thoughts:
The platforming in this game was fast paced, tight, and innovative 
for being an indie title. The ability to use the marker to solve 
puzzles also offered multiple ways to tackle situations which makes 
every players experience unique. The story, even though its nothing too 
special is about brothers and the bond between them as Max attempts to 
save his brother from an evil wizard, and as a brother myself I 
always have a special sympathy for these kinds of stories.
