Thoughts:
The gunplay in Spec Ops is fine. It services the real stand out here which is the story. The story is a horrific 
tale of PTSD and war that most games don't even come close to tackling. Each decision the player makes feels painful 
as every option is a bad one. The game makes you do things you don't want to do, and really forces you to take a hard 
look at the grim realities of combat and the refugee crisis it can create. The setting of Dubai over taken by sand 
is also beautiful and it lends itself to interesting scenarios where shooting windows or ceilings can have devestating 
sand piles flow in and change the pace of combat. This game is super interesting and super quick for those looking for 
a refreshing narrative in the world of war shooters. I highly recommend.
