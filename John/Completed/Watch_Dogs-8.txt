Thoughts:
Great game. Decent story with some heavy themes, beautiful city of Chicago with great use 
of new and old areas. The gun play and hand to hand combat is great as well as enjoyable 
use of technology. Its a great SF title that really makes you think about the way tech is 
moving and how it can really change the world. Also at the end when you kill the main gangster 
by stopping his electronic pace maker, I struggled with that decision because it was so much 
more than a swift bullet of vigilante justice. The pace maker made is more human, more personal. 
Great game for a new franchise.
