Thoughts:
While Killzone has its moments, the game honestly falls flat with repetitive 
game play and a boring/ugly setting. When the original Kill Zone had come out 
in the early 2000's it had nailed the gritty cyber punk look it was going for, 
but over time as the view of cyber punk changed the art kind of stagnated into 
what can honestly at times look like garbage. Also while the main narrative 
was rather dull, the over arching themes of mass genocide and what that can 
mean in the context of war was interesting. Killing the main character at the 
end was also a great/surprising plot twist. The game play does have its stand 
out moments when it is in zero gravity or taking a slower more stealth based approach. 
However overall this was just another basic shooter and kind of felt stale for most of its game play.
