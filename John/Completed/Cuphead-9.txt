Thoughts:
Cuphead is hard. Easily one of the hardest games I've played all year, and yet thats what makes it so addicting. 
Each boss is so unique from music to animations, and they're all short enough that dying hundreds of times never feels really to bad.
I died at least 200 times to beat the game, but it was worth it. Each battle was tense and plenty of them had me winning
with only a single life left. The only problem is that a few of the attacks in the game feel cheap in that they have almost 0
wind up frames. Also the airplane levels should have the ability to shoot backwards, it would make the game way better during
those flying missions.
