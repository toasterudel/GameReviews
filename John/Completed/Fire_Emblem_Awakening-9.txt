Thoughts:
One of the best turn based strategy games of all time, Fire Emblem Awakening may 
easily be my favorite 3ds game. The storylines with different self contained plots 
and an amazing over arching narrative really blew my mind while playing this game. 
After 10 hours of playing I had beaten the main boss and felt satisfied with my 
game time, but where I expected credits to roll and entire new continent appeared 
on the map and kept the story going for twice as long as the first. The Fire Emblem 
combat mechanics are solid and every character feels unique and special given all 
different unique abilities. Using them to carry out strike missions always felt 
amazing, splitting units in squads and tearing through the battlefield was always 
one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done in a strategy game.
