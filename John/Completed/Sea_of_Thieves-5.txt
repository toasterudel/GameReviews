Thoughts:
Playing as a pirate and sailing a ship across the sea is fun, especially with friends.
However, there really is no actual content in the game. Every "quest" is either a fetch
or kill type of quest. The variation of gameplay is just so dull that it really is hard
to come back too. After 10 hours I genuinely have seen everything the game has to offer.
