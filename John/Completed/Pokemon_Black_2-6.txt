Thoughts:
This is the first game to really dig into the idea of whether or not owning Pokemon 
was OK at all. They also utilized interesting 2d views to create 3d objects during 
some massive set pieces that was greatly appreciated. However, the world was a bit 
strange as compared to past games and the new Pokemon were all rather bland to say the least.
