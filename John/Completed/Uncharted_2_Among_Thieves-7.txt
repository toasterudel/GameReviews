Thoughts: 
The story in this game is great, the cast is interesting and no character really feels wasted. 
They also fixed the cover system for the most part, which in Uncharted 1 was a real problem for me. 
However, the combat sections were sometimes unfairly hard. Drake dies way to quickly and sometimes 
the RPGS and shotguns just one shot you before you even know what happened. Which is super annoying 
because when you pick them up to turn them on the enemy it feels like all your bullets were replaced with peas.
I also constantly found myself lost looking for the right way to leave an area, with no clear way ever really
presented when attempting to find the exit. Overall I think this game is pretty much on par with the original.
While its graphics and story move the franchise forward, I think the combat and level design hold it back.
