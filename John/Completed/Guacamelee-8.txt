Thoughts:
Guacamelee! is a fun and surprisingly in depth look at Mexican heritage and mythology. 
Both the art and music are beautiful while the narrative really draws from the culture 
from which the theme is derived.  The game play is tight for the most part and the 
multiplayer was easy and fun to use. The amount of fun I had while playing this with 
my brother made it an even better experience and learning new moves and combos to access 
new areas was rewarding and added new mechanics to combat. The boss fight also all felt 
unique and the approaches to each boss felt fresh and fun to deal with.
