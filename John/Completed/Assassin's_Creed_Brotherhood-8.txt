Thoughts:
A great natural progression from AC2. Not as long(time wise) or as deep(narratively speaking) but still an amazing game. 
Leonardo Davinci plays a great role and the brotherhood system was the best part 
about the game. The city of Rome was well mapped and the horse was a useful tool in game. 
The story was an addition to Ezios quest for answers and vengeance and overall served 
its purpose well. Also the Colosseum was extremely well done, an excellent set piece.
