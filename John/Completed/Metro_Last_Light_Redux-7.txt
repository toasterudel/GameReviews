Thoughts:
So much better than the first game. Pretty much all my problems of the 
first game have been solved. The lore of the game is much more played out, 
with the Nazi's and Red's having a substantial role in the story. Overall 
a much more interesting tale in the metro, and a better story about the 
dark ones and their true purpose in the world. Wouldn't recommend it, 
but definitely an enjoyable experience compared to the first one.
