Thoughts:
War is absolute hell, and no game captures that better than Valiant Hearts. Taking views 
from all sides of WWI this game follows the story of 4 brave souls and their struggles to 
survive the war and maintain morality and humanity.  Each story was emotional and the way 
the 4 heroes constantly intertwined was excellent story telling. The ending was also an 
amazing reflection of war itself and makes this game one of the most detailed war stories in gaming.
