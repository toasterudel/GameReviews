Thoughts:
Since this website separates the episodes into different games, the one will just 
go for the game as a whole. That was amazing! The story was fresh, fun, and engaging, 
while also sticking 100% to the borderlands flavor of tone and comedy.  The voice acting 
was amazing with stand out performances from Laura Bailey, Ashley Johnson, and Chris Hardwick. 
The main 4 characters were lovable and the supporting cast, both new and returning from 
previous installments, fit perfectly into the narrative flow. It was just a solid story of 
revenge, loss, and redemption all woven perfectly into the Borderlands narratives of the first 
two main series games. Last but not least, my favorite part of the whole game... The cinematic 
song intros. The five opening credit scenes were amazing, the song choices for each fit perfectly 
into the current tone of the story, and the animations just felt so surreal and in touch with the 
music to get players hype for whats to come. This game was an amazing tale to experience, easily 
my favorite Telltale game and I will recommend it for years to come to anyone looking for a great/fun narrative experience.
