Thoughts:
Capturing the essence of WWI is a daunting task in gaming. 
Balancing the historical accuracy with the fun of video games is 
hard but the studio at DICE has managed to strike a healthy balance. 
The multiplayer is tight and the squad combat is usually well maintained.  
The war story single player is an excellent way to tell stories from WWI 
though it did feel a little too short in certain places. Also they reused 
multiplayer maps to fill the single player which is just kind of a cheap trick.
